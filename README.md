Practical Example For good Documentation Practices

This project is created with the intention of showing how a code must be documentated. 
In here we show examples of good naming and a meaningfull docstring with clear description of the implemented functionalities.

For seeing the examples, clone the repository from  https://github.com/esciencecenter-digital-skills/coderefinery-documentation-example-project.git and look into analyse_spreedsheet.py file
¨¨¨import pandas as pd¨¨¨
For running these functionalities, you must have an example excel file lodaded in the same work directory where you execute the script.
